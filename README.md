# Debiased Self-Training Implementation

This repository contains my implementation of the techniques from the paper "Debiased Self-Training for Semi-Supervised Learning" by Baixu Chen et al., published in 2022. The project focuses on enhancing semi-supervised learning by reducing biases inherent in self-training processes.

## Project Description

The codebase is structured to demonstrate the practical application of Debiased Self-Training (DST) in machine learning models. It includes experiments and analyses that align with the methodologies described in the paper.

## Contents

- `DST.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the core implementation and experiments.
- `modified_volcanoes.csv`: Dataset used for one of the experiments.
- `modified_voting.csv`: Another dataset used for the semi-supervised learning experiments.
- `requirements.txt`: This file contains the name of all the python libraries necessary to run this project. 
- `Debiased Self Training`: A PDF version of the research paper this project is based on. 

## Getting Started

To run this project:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Open `DST.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to see the implementation and results.
